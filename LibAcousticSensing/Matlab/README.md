# LibAS Remote Matlab Server

## Setup

## Remote Mode
LibAS allows developers to focus on **what kind of sound signal to be played for sensing** and **how to process the reception of each sent signal**. For example, if the purpose of application is to estimate the distance of nearby object, just like SONAR, you can just send a short tone in every 50ms and just monitor what is time of delay to recieve the echo of this tone in each 50ms. In our remote mode, you can achieve it by creating your own **Main** and **Callback** functions as shown in the following:

### Your Main Function

### Your Callback Function


## Remote  to Standalone


## Classes

### AudioSource


### SensingServer

### TraceParser

## Internal LibAS Functions

### Preamble Detection
