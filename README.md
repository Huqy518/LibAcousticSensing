# LibAcousticSensing
LibAS (LibAcousticSensing) is a cross-platform toolkit to ease the development of acoustic sensing apps. 
If can let developers focus on design the sensing algorithm rather without learning the platform-specific programming details.
LibAS currently support Android/iOS/Tizen/Linux devices.
Some interesting demo video of LibAS can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnep7fFyJhc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8imJVRDq4

# Acoustic Sensing
Since microphones and speakers have been installed in all smart phones, 
sensing by (inaudible) sounds, i.e., acoustic sensing, becomes a unique way to augment advanced sensing capability to human life.
It can remember where the phone is, know how user touch the phone, identify nearby objects, or even understand the user's gestures.
Few popular examples are like FingerIO (https://youtu.be/CQ-AirK7wLY) and ForcePhone (https://youtu.be/HioOAiMzxBM). 

# Usage


# Remote Mode (need Matlab)


# Standalone Mode (need to know Phone programing)
